            <p>As poor college students aiming to relieve our immense educational debts with the [prospective] jobs of our futures, we were interested in seeing whether or not this idea of “a higher education” really enables you to succeed financially. </p> -->
            <h1>Should you obtain a higher education?</h1>
            <p> For many, it only seems natural to attend college as soon as
                their secondary education is complete. However, for others, 
                this is a question that is commonly asked as they must weigh
                out the payoff from their potential financial stability compared
                to the immense educational debt they may incur. </p>

</br>
            <h1>Our Goal</h1>
            <p> As college students questioning our benefits of attending college,
                we are interested in seeing whether or not there is a link between
                higher education and financial success.<br>
                By creating visualizations between data pertaining to education 
                and income, we aim to allow users to come to their own conclusions 
                about possible correlations when deciding whether or not to pursue college.  </p>
